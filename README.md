# Sodium Shadowy Path Blocks

SSPB reintroduces vanilla-like lighting to all non-fluid blocks with inset tops (e.g. dirt paths and how they have dark shading when directly next to a full block), as Sodium removes this.

You can also change the strength of this shading.

This lighting is not exactly the same as vanilla, only vanilla-like.

Requires Sodium (duh).
